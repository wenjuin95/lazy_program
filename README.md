<h1>TIMER AND BUTTON TO OPEN INTRA</h1>

i try to make a program that help me to open everything by one button (still in process)
if you guys want the executable file you can use pyinstaller to convert python file to executable file

<h2>GUIDE (STILL IN PROCESS)</h2>

1. check your pyinstaller does it exist

        pyinstaller -v

2. if not exit try to install with pip

        pip install pyinstaller

3. now you can convert the python file to executable file (replace "file" with the name of your python file)

        pyinstaller <file>.py --onefile --windowed

4. you can go to "dist" folder to look for exe
