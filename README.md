<h1>CLOCK AND BUTTON TO OPEN INTRA</h1>

<h2>Only for 42 student</h2>
<p>i try to make a program that help me to open everything by one button (still in process)</p>
<p>if you want your own you can go to custom.py</p>
<p>if you guys want the executable file you can use pyinstaller to convert python file to executable file</p>

<h2>GUIDE (STILL IN PROCESS)</h2>

1. check your pyinstaller does it exist

        pyinstaller -v

2. if not exit try to install with pip

        pip install pyinstaller

3. (window: use power shell)now you can convert the python file to executable file (replace "YOUR_USER_NAME" with your user name and "your_script_name.py" with the name of your python file)

        python C:\Users\[YOUR_USER_NAME]\AppData\...Scripts\pyinstaller.exe --onefile [your_script_name.py]

3. (macos) (replace "your_script_name.py" with the name of your python file)

        pyinstaller --onefile --windowed [your_script_name.py]

4. you can go to "dist" folder to look for exe
